      <p class="text-lg mb-3">I’m so glad you’ve made your way to my page. You may have noticed the countdown clock on my homepage—I'm currently finishing up my Naturopathic Medical education, which includes my final graduation (yay) and licensing exams. There’s a lot more to come, and I’m excited to start providing care soon, so stay tuned!</p>
      <p class="mb-3">In the meantime, I want to share a bit about myself and my approach to your healthcare. To backtrack a bit, I have a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Toxicology and a minor in Nutritional and Nutraceutical Sciences. This is where I first learned about all the complexities of the human body, and how it functions! I also developed a strong understanding of the exposures and habits that have the potential to cause the body harm, as well as the positive impact that certain nutrients, exercises, and healthy habits can have on a human’s health trajectory. After this 5-year degree, I then completed my 4-year Doctor of Naturopathy Degree, which puts me where I am today!</p>
      <p class="mb-3">When it comes to healthcare, I recognize how easy it can be for your health concerns to be pushed aside by the demands of everyday life. Between family life, work, bills, a social life?, and all the other demands on your time. Not to mention our overburdened healthcare system that may also limit your care. It is really no wonder you feel unsupported in your health and unsure of where to turn for help.</p>
      <p>Now this is where I aim to make a difference. My mission is to give you the time and a safe space to share your health concerns, past experiences, and goals. I want to hear your full story, so that I can then use my knowledge and clinical experience, the latest research, and your preferences to do the detective work and eventually get you feeling better.</p>
      <p>No more days of frustration with nobody to talk about your concerns. No more days of frantically googling or tik toking health topics only to overwhelm yourself. That’s what I’m here for! I'm excited to work together.</p>
